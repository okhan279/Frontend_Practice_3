This projects further builds on what I have learnt with HTML and CSS. The code is based on the following webpage:
                    https://jolly-kalam-23776e.netlify.app/cssgridresponsive/
The purpose of this task was to further understand HTML and CSS concepts and to introduce the use of CSS grids into my projects.


Note regarding a problem uploading to GitHub:
When trying to upload the document onto GitHub I had the error:
    'error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/okhan279/Frontend_Practice_3.git'

To clear this error, I used 'git push' and was given the following message:
    fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

After copy-pasting 'git push --set-upstream origin master' and then using 'git push' I was able to push my local repository to GitHub.
